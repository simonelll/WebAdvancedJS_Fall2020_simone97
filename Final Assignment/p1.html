        <strong>My Partner:</strong> <a href="https://cc-portfolio-zijia.glitch.me/p1.html">Zijia Chen(Ace)</a><br>
        <strong>The object description I received:</strong> 
        <br>"A black cap with a rolling stone tongue symbol. It was a cool cap. I lost it on the driveway outside my apartment and it was ran over by many cars already. I was super sad about that.
        <br><strong>Click </strong><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/ximinliu/sketches/Ry_762OqY">here</a> to see my code.

        Design Process

      <p>
        Firstly, I drew the image that I saw in the description: a cap from the side view, and then started to make it.
        <br>The biggest challenge through the process was the rolling stone tongue icon. I tried to use bezier curve, or to load outside images, but they didnâ€™t work well. Then I tried pixel style, calculated pixels, sketched it first(Picture1) and finally worked it out. 
        <br>I also added some words to show the lost&found theme.

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p><strong>1.The language your partner used to describe the image</strong> <br> It was quite clear, and with lots of emotional words.</p>
      <p><strong>2.Your interpretation of the image</strong><br>I was actually thinking of cars running over a falling cap.</p>
      <p><strong>3.The depiction of the image using code</strong><br>The interpretation at this stage didn't go very smoothly. Because when I was thinking and sketching, I focused on how it could be like. But I paid more attention to numbers and the components when coding.</p>
      <p><strong>4.The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment</strong><br>The final outcome is different from what I thought it would be like. Maybe that's how the language and tool we use to communicate have an impact on the content we deliver.</p>
