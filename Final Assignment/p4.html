      <h4>New story I created</h4>
        A mermaid finding herself pregnant in the waves.
      <br>
        I came here along the way from the three original stories.
        Frida Kahlo was a woman with strong self-identity and was vocal about feminity. But she was so unlucky to lost the ability to get pregnant in her life as a woman.
        The grandma shows love and pass it on to next generations. 
        I think both of these female figures have their own power. Moreover, they show more willingness to use their power to influence the next generations. 
        So here I combined all these thoughts and visualize the process of their pregnant.

      <p>
        It was hard for me to make a new exquiste corpse from the original ones because they were too different and seemingly unmatched. 
        But no sooner did I realized that it's part of challenges Critical Computation planned to pose to us: to play with limitations.
        It's the first time I think of the story first, but not the code.
        It was much eaiser for coding part this time, but harder for the story.
