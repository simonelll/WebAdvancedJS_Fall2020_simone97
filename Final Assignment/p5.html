        Design Process
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> People’s activities on their mobile phones are easily peeped by those who stand beside them. Or, the surveillance camera may capture private information on people’s mobile phones when they’re walking while looking down on their phones on the street.
        <br>
        <strong>Sender:</strong> Oneself.
        <br>
        <strong>Recipient:</strong> Oneself. 
        <br>
        <strong>Medium:</strong> Mobile Phone.
        <br>
        <strong>Visual Strategy:</strong> To make the content only accessible (or visible) to the user himself, I used moire pattern to prevent people from other angles than the straight plain perspective to see the screen.
      
      </p>
      

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        
      <strong> How identity and/or interests influence the basic choices about what to design and who to design for. </strong>
        <br>
      My idea came from daily life and was also inspired from Decodelia create by Melanie Hoff. Metro is the most frequent way of transportation to the working class. On their way to work, there're risks that their private messages can been seen from other people and cameras they come across.
        <br>
      <strong> Your choice of visual strategy and how well it worked to accomplish your goals. </strong>
        <br>
      My choice to use the method of Moire Pattern and WEBGL is a successful one. Because the sender is the receiver in my project, so I need a way to conceal the information from the screen when the mobile phone is watched by others, which means it's not in a straight plain perspective. Moire pattern is a suitable way here and I also used 3D rotation to simulate the use of mobile phones.
